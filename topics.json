    "content": "Why it matters:\n- Writing grows from oral language, play, and talk.\n- Learners benefit from visible models and scaffolds.\n\nTry this:\n1) Picture Prompts Circle — Show a rich image. Learners say what they notice; teacher lists words/phrases on the board.\n2) Sentence Stems — Provide starters (e.g., 'I opened the door and…'). Learners complete orally, then write.\n3) Word Banks — Build themed word lists together before writing (characters, settings, actions).\n\nSupport:\n- Use quick 'plan, say, write, check' routine.\n- Offer frames: Beginning / Middle / Ending.",
